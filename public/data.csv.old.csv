"8/18/2025, 9:29:13.406 AM",1,1.34.1,Query execution has lot of issues and very slow.
"8/11/2025, 11:14:45.81 AM",2,1.34.0,workflow needs vast improvment. Unable to view two queries at once is bad. Im not even able to quickly create a new window of the same database (i need to reconnect each time) What was wront with azure data studio?
"8/7/2025, 10:59:16.924 AM",2,1.34.0,It does not co-exist well with the postgresql extension. I much preferred Azure Data Studio. There are issues with sp_blitzwho getting live query plans doesn't render in vscode but worked well in ADS. Overall the mssql extension is a poor cousin to ADS.
"8/3/2025, 9:41:12.453 PM",2,1.34.0,"If this is supposed to the replacement for Azure Data Studio, it needs to be much more like Azure Data Studio in behaviour. At the moment it feels like an afterthought add-on, with integration feeling very clunkly. The are to many things to list here at the moment that need improvement, but the most pressing issue is that every time I make a new query into a data base I have to re-authenticate. This is infuriating when I am making multiple new queries a minute as part of a data investigation. Once I have authenticated to a particular server, there should be a sensible length of time before I need to re-authenticate to that database, e.g. wait at least 1 hour before needing to re-authenticate to a particular server."

"7/27/2025, 10:51:59.332 PM",2,1.34.0,"Are you dogfooding this? It's just not a very good tool. Azure data studio had it's issues, but the switchover to just a plugin in VS Code was premature. Too many things default to ""i'm a coder who occasionally uses sql"" rather than ""my primary environment is SQL""."
"7/25/2025, 8:54:14.346 AM",2,1.34.0,"Compared to Azure Data Studio, the MSSQL extension just feels much slower and clunkier, which in turn is far slower than SSMS.

Right now the current statement command only executes the FIRST statement in the selection. ""select 'a'; |select 'b'; select 'c';"" correctly returns b. ""select 'a'; |select 'b';| select 'c';"" correctly returns b. But ""|select 'a'; select 'b';| select 'c';"" incorrectly only returns a, when it should return two resultsets, one a and one b.

The ""Query Results"" window height is same for all the Query Windows.  Which is quiet uncomfortable while working in multiple windows.  When each query window has it's own query results view then it should have its own height.   E.g.  I am writing a Procedure in one window and I want maximum area for Writing SQL and no results window needed, while in another query window I am writing working SQL Queries for debugging and I want query results window here."

"7/25/2025, 12:22:14.493 PM",5,1.34.0,honestly I don't understand why ADS couldn't be supported instead of forcing data people onto your application coding platform

"8/18/2025, 7:04:29.568 AM",5,1.34.1,when running multiple queries the space between the different result tables are very big and you have to do an annoying amount of scrolling and potentially completely miss that you actually receive multple results.

"8/8/2025, 3:47:30.853 PM",6,1.34.0,"I've encountered several usability issues with the MSSQL extension in Visual Studio Code that make the experience less reliable compared to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):  Connection Icon State Confusion The connection icons often do not accurately reflect the current state. Even when connected to a database, the icon does not always show a “disconnect” option. Clicking the button frequently prompts me to select a different database rather than providing a clear way to disconnect. This makes managing connections less intuitive.  Query Selection After Connecting If I attempt to execute a SELECT statement while disconnected, I’m prompted to select and wait for a database connection, which is fine. However, after connecting, the extension re-evaluates what is highlighted and executes whatever is currently selected—often not what I originally had highlighted when I triggered the execution. This is different (and less helpful) behavior compared to SSMS, where the original selection is what gets executed after connecting. This sometimes results in running the wrong query, which can be risky.  Tab and Result Mismatch When switching tabs while a connection is being established or a query is running, there are cases where the results of a query show up under the wrong editor tab. This can be confusing and leads to mistakes, especially when working with multiple queries across different databases.  IntelliSense Cache It seems that IntelliSense metadata is refreshed every time a new connection is established, resulting in slower query writing experiences. I would prefer if IntelliSense information (such as <REDACTED: user-file-path> suggestions) could be cached for longer periods or persist between connections to the same <REDACTED: user-file-path>, rather than requiring a full refresh every time.  Overall, these issues make the extension feel less predictable and harder to use efficiently, especially for those who are accustomed to SSMS behavior. Improving connection state visibility, query selection logic, <REDACTED: user-file-path> alignment, and IntelliSense caching would make a significant difference.  Thank you for your work on this extension!"

It stops working constantly and then requires me to reboot all of VSCode to work again, which is crazy.  If it hasn't stopped working, it will sometimes make me run queries multiple times as it gets index out of range exceptions in the results view the first time.  Intellisense is also so good when it works, but sometimes it just doesn't load.  When the extension is working - it is GREAT.  It just only is working 40-60% of the time."
"8/6/2025, 12:21:14.524 PM",6,1.34.0,"- first, I appreciate the development of this free product. I'm satisfied with the more ""core"" part of it (creating and using different connections, running SQL code inside the work I'm doing in VS Code). - but, I'm not so much satisfied with the query results <REDACTED: user-file-path>, I believe it can be improved. and I use this extension mainly for having easy results along with when I code. but recently I've needed to work with SLS SMS again, due to bugs in this results <REDACTED: user-file-path> many times, when I run a query, the grid in the query results, has some bugs, don't update with the latest query results (still has the previous results). also, it's not trivial to copy / paste the results (CTRL+C doesn't work; need to select a specific ""Copy"", there are 2 different Copy in the menu that shows up in right click). adjusting columns sizes is not trivial either (no double click auto adjust; if the column is in the far right, it seems it's not possible to increase its width in 1 time, need to do multiple small increases)."

"7/31/2025, 10:23:48.771 AM",6,1.34.0,There needs to be more feature parity with both Azure Data Studio and SSMS when the mssql extension is in use. The ability to port over to VS Code extensions that were only available in ADS would also be useful.

Yall have improved it SOOO much in the last ~six months, and i love the focus shift from azure data studio to this extension.  As background, I am someone who uses a lot of SQL to do analysis and browse data directly, rather than pulling data into other analytical tools.  - I love that you resurected the option to display results in a separate window. I prefer this greatly because i often limit my columns to only those that i need, and i often am writing very long queries... so i need nice height for my query editor, and i dont demand that much width for my results table. - One dream of mine would be an even MORE <REDACTED: user-file-path> tailor-able way to view the data.     - Number formatting         - Something to allow for quick formatting of numeric fields. Maybe a quick little button that formats numbers with commas and 2 decimals or something. I would also love it if this formatting was persisted by column name upon rerunning the query (maybe asking too much).         - It always feels like a nuisance to wrap my columns in the sql format function.     - Option to visually display column data types. This one is stolen from the databricks browser, but it is super clean. - Updates through VPN.     - My work VPN blocks the updates to the extension... no idea how this works behind the scenes, but i know the VS app itself has the rights to update itself, so i would love if that were the case for this extension too.       - When there is an update, my query doesnt go through and i have to disconect from the VPN in order to update the extension... and i dont want to install locally because yall have so many good new updates. - Database browser     - My workplace has an old app called AQT for browsing some old Db2 databases... the app sucks, but it has EPIC browsing features....         - A search bar for searching database for table names, views, column names, etc.         - Abilitiy to browse the columns of a table *using* a table.... meaning i get name, data type, PK, size, whatever in a little table, and i can sort by the different columns."
